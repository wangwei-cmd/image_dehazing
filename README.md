# image_dehazing
Matlab codes for "A constrained total variation model for single image dehazing" by Wei Wang, Chuanjiang He, Xiang-Gen Xia.

Run demondehaze.m to test the dehazing effect of our method.

The smootht.m is from Amir Beck and Marc Teboulle, "Fast Gradient-Based Algorithms for Constrained Total Variation Image Denoising and Deblurring Problems".
